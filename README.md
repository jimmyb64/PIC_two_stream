# PIC_two_stream
PIC (particle in cell) simulation of the two stream instability (two counter streaming beams) in 1D (no B field).  Code calculates the motions of electron under the Poisson-Maxwell equation using the PIC method.  Code in written in Python3, and is based on the example given by [Philip Mozc](https://medium.com/swlh/create-your-own-plasma-pic-simulation-with-python-39145c66578b).  An associated [GitHub](https://github.com/pmocz/pic-python) repsoitory is also provided.  This code is written in replacement of the MATLAB exercise that is missing from the EPFL course: Introduction to Plasma Physics.
